# SoulsRM-source-cleanup
Cleanup of the Souls Remastered game source code by Retrobytes Productions, as well as compatibility (specifically the keypress check) for my TC2048 in particular (and every other TC2048 out there)
The available source code doesn't seem to have any license attached, so neither does this code.

Currently struggling with the ZXBasic compiler, which is why there are so many 'END IF's with :rem's before them; bug report in progress
